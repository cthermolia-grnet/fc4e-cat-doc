# Welcome to FC4E CAT documentation

CAT also known as Compliance Assessment Toolkit for EOSC is a set of concepts, implemented as a graph database and accessible via APIs, and supported by user interfaces via the APIs. 

The Compliance Assessment Toolkit will support the EOSC PID policy with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. To do so, a wide range of compliance requirements ( TRUST, FAIR, PID Policy, Reproducibility, GDPR, Licences) will be evaluated as use cases for definition of a conceptual model. At the same time, vocabularies, concepts, and designs are intended to be re-usable for other compliance needs: TRUST, FAIR, POSI, CARE, Data Commons, etc. This will be followed by a supporting service specification (the framework), accompanied  by development and testing of operational services for PID Policy Compliance monitoring. Though primarily aimed at machine-actionable operations, the API-based services will be complemented by user interfaces to broaden its use. 

The component will create the following resources:

 - **Vocabulary services**, based on a conceptual model, that can be used to characterise, describe, and encode compliance regimes - with an operational version of the EOSC PID Compliance regime deployed. We will also include beta versions of other compliance assessment regimes - specifically FAIR and TRUST. These can be used as a starting point for operationalisation of additional regimes.
 - **API services (REST APIs)** that allows for the encoding, recording, and querying of compliance assessments. Operational examples will support EOSC PID Policy compliance, while FAIR and TRUST will be available as beta versions.
 - **User Interfaces** based on the APIs that support the use of the APIs within websites and applications.
